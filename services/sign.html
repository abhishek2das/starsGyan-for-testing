                                    They are highly energetic people like an army man because this sign is ruled by
                                    Mars. They like to do exciting things and often lose interest in routine and
                                    predictable works. They easily get angry but quickly calm down if you listen to
                                    them. They are active, aggressive, impatient, and always remain busy physically or
                                    mentally. Inattentiveness is their big weakness, so they always need guidance and
                                    new challenges to succeed in life. <br>
                                    They have an athletic physique and you can easily recognize them in a crowd.
                                    Selfrespect is a big factor for them in any relationship. <br>
                                    Number 1 and 9 play a significant role in their life. January, March, April, October
                                    and November are the most eventful time of the year for them. They are prone to
                                    headache, arthritis, diabetes, skin allergy, blood disorder, and lower back pain.
